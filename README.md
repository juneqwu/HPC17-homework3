## Spring 2017: High Performance Computing 

### Assignment 3 

Problem 1: See write-up for the report of timing. When running int_ring and array_ring, add the second argument to specify the number of rounds of communication. Otherwise, the message will be passed for one round. int_ring passes a single integer around the processes to test latency; array_ring passes an array of size 2MB to test bandwidth.
